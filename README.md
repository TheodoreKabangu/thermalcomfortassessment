# thermalcomfortassessment
This project was initiated as a final assignment for the course of Smart Energy Technologies in Building.
Our goal is to understand the factors that affect thermal comfort according to ASHRAE 55 and utilize provided tools for thermal comfort assessment. 
We have used Python 3.10, pandas 2.2.2, pythermalcomfort 2.10.0, numpy 1.26.4, and matplotlib 3.9.0 in google colab.

We have followed data-driven decision making process as methodology, which is comprised of 5 steps:
1.Questions
2. Data wrangling
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Conclusions
5. Communication

The analysed data was collected using HOBO Data Logger MX 1101 and due to this availability, the Question step has been moved to the second position allowing us to start from Data wrangling.
